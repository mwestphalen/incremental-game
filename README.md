# Cybernetic Incremental Game 

## Project Overview

This repository hosts the Cybernetic Odyssey Incremental Game, a front-end development project focused on creating an incremental (clicker/idle) game. The game involves clicking a button to increment numbers, buying upgrades, defending against cyber threats, and unlocking achievements based on the premise that the user is a cybernetic entity in a digital word.

## Features

- **Incremental Click Mechanics**: A primary button to click and increase numbers, symbolizing the collection of *data packets* and the core game mechanics.
- **Upgrades**: Purchase upgrades to accelerate number incrementation (code optimizers, AI companions, firewall shields, etc.), with one upgrade initially hidden until a specific action is triggered.
- **Achievements**: Unlockable achievements relevant to the game's theme and become a *Master of the Matrix*.
- **Thematic Design**: Customized styling and layout to fit the cybernetic theme.
- **Interactive UI**: Dynamic user interface using DOM manipulation techniques.
